# Breakout Rogue Crush

A playable Breakout clone with roguelike/roguelite elements that can be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Roguelike Elements

- **Procedurally generated levels**: Each level has a randomized brick layout
- **Power-ups**: Collect power-ups to permanently upgrade your abilities
- **Permadeath with persistence**: When you lose all lives, the game ends but your high score is saved
- **Toughness system**: Bricks require multiple hits to destroy (1-3)

## How to Play

1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move your paddle
2. Break all bricks to advance to the next level
3. Collect power-ups that drop from destroyed bricks:
   - ðŸŸ© Green: Extra life
   - ðŸŸª Purple: Wider paddle
   - ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: Faster ball
   - ðŸŸ¦ Blue: Multi ball (bonus points)
4. Don't let the ball fall below your paddle!
5. Press SPACE to restart after game over
